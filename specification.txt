3. How I chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap
I chose to use JavaScript because of its ability to create dynamic and interactive
web pages, as well as its widespread use and support in web development.

I chose to use Bootstrap because of its responsive design features, which make it easy
to create mobile-friendly websites, and its pre-designed components, which can save time
and effort in styling.
